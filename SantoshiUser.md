# Music Player Application + First PC Build

## Summary
I have been learning the programming and related technologies which seems very interesting to me.
Because of it , i recently joined many programming course where i get to know about android application 
development.This just boomed my interest in making a android application.so I wanted making a
android application.But due to lack of hardware resource , i was never financially able to make it.So, i 
want to make a music player application by building a PC from scratch. After doing some research with my
teachers and some builders, i am confident that i can build PC where i can make android application. 
I'm even happy to know that my brother will also help me in this project.Even though, i will be  
guiding the project , I think this will be wonderful opportunity for both of us to to experince process of 
application development along with a building from scratch.i am very excited for this project even my brother
is too excited for this. I will be completing this project with @Amareshaw



## Plan
To build a PC, first of all, we will figure out what parts we need to build PC from our teacher.
This PC build will require no special skills, we just need parts to put together.
we will be guided my our techer how to assemble the Parts we picked up.After the build is 
completed,Then We will install the operating system in it, from a bootable pendrive.We will then check
everything is working fine in it. if it is working fine the build will be complete.
For the music player app first we need to download and install a android studio.then we will download the SDK required for 
the libraries that help in developing a application.After the android studio is done, Then we will 
make music player application by the help of documentaion of Google for android and guidance from teacher who have good 
experience in building application.
In this way, we are going to complete Music player application and our First PC build.
